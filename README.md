# GUI
Qt-based GUI for the overarching SCDA project.

[2021/01/30]
The GUI project in Qt Creator is live, and it posesses all of the functionality of the previous "Database" program. Specifically, the GUI version of Database can scan any chosen drive for census-year folders, and allow the user to pick and choose which years should be loaded into the SQL database. After loading the requested bulk data, it can display requested information as a list. 

The current GUI posesses a drop-down selection list, a multi-selection widget list, a viewscreen to display results, and a multitude of push-buttons. Now that the core functionality in Qt is working, there is enormous potential to improve the project's demonstrable abilities - in short order.
